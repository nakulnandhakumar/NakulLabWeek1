Hi! My name is Nakul Nandhakumar. I'm 20 years old and am currently a Sophomore. I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and planning to minor in Physics. I'm very interested in fields such as Device Physics and Quantum Computing and plan to attend graduate school in the future. I really enjoy PBL courses and have always enjoyed coding in a team, especially when the project relates to real life issues. I am looking forward to the rest of CSE 110.
